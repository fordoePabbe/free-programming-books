With MagicPicker 2.2, you can access a color wheel that lets you choose colors from different models, such as RGB, HSB, CMYK, Lab, Lch, and more. You can also adjust the brightness, saturation, hue, and temperature of your colors with intuitive sliders.

You can also save your favorite colors in a color history slider that preserves them between sessions.
 
One of the most exciting features of MagicPicker 2.2 is the Munsell color wheel mode, which is based on the industry standard for human-perceived colors. This mode lets you choose colors with extended ranges of red, blue, and yellow, and displays the Munsell values on the bottom of the wheel. You can also switch to a red-up mode for traditional painting.
 
MagicPicker 2.2 also works with vectors in Photoshop and Illustrator, allowing you to change their opacity with a slider. You can also use a semi-transparent HUD mode that pops up anywhere on the screen under your cursor, without covering your image. You can adjust the transparency and blur of the HUD to suit your preferences.
