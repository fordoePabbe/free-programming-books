1. Open CorelDRAW X5 and go to Help > About CorelDRAW.
2. Click on the Phone Corel button and note down the installation code.
3. Call the Corel Customer Support number for your region and provide them with your installation code and serial number.
4. They will give you an activation code that you need to enter in the Activation Code field.
